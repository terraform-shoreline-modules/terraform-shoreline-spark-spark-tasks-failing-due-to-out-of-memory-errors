### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark tasks failing due to out of memory errors.
---

This incident type refers to a situation where Spark tasks are failing due to out of memory errors. Spark is a distributed computing system used for big data processing. When the data volume exceeds the allocated memory, the Spark tasks fail, and the system generates an out of memory error. This type of incident can cause data processing delays or even system downtime, which can impact the overall performance of the application.

### Parameters
```shell
export SPARK_HOME="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_APP_DIR="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_APP_LOG_DIR="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_MEMORY_ALLOCATION="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SPARK_CONFIGURATION_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export MEMORY_SIZE_FOR_THE_SPARK_DRIVER="PLACEHOLDER"

export URL_OF_SPARK_MASTER="PLACEHOLDER"

export MEMORY_SIZE_FOR_EACH_SPARK_EXECUTOR="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check system memory usage
```shell
free -m
```

### Check if the system is running low on memory
```shell
vmstat -s
```

### Check the amount of available memory
```shell
cat /proc/meminfo
```

### Check the amount of memory used by Spark processes
```shell
ps -e -o pid,user,%mem,command | grep "spark"
```

### Check the logs for out of memory errors
```shell
grep -i "out of memory" /var/log/messages
```

### Check the Spark configuration for memory settings
```shell
cat ${SPARK_HOME}/conf/spark-defaults.conf | grep -E "spark.executor.memory|spark.driver.memory"
```

### Check the Spark application code for memory-intensive operations
```shell
grep -r "cache" ${SPARK_APP_DIR}
```

### Check the Spark application logs for memory-related errors
```shell
grep -i "out of memory" ${SPARK_APP_LOG_DIR}/*
```

### Check the system logs for memory-related errors
```shell
dmesg | grep -i "oom\|out of memory"
```

### Insufficient memory allocation for Spark tasks.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define variables

SPARK_HOME=${SPARK_HOME}

SPARK_MASTER_URL=${URL_OF_SPARK_MASTER}

SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=${MEMORY_SIZE_FOR_EACH_SPARK_EXECUTOR}

SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY=${MEMORY_SIZE_FOR_THE_SPARK_DRIVER}



# Check memory allocation configuration

echo "Checking memory allocation configuration..."

if grep -q "spark.executor.memory" $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf && grep -q "spark.driver.memory" $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf; then

  echo "Memory allocation configuration is already set."

else

  echo "Memory allocation configuration is not set. Setting configuration..."

  echo "spark.executor.memory $SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY" >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf

  echo "spark.driver.memory $SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY" >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf

fi



# Check Spark cluster status

echo "Checking Spark cluster status..."

if $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --master $SPARK_MASTER_URL --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi $SPARK_HOME/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.4.0.jar 10; then

  echo "Spark cluster is running."

else

  echo "Spark cluster is not running. Please check the Spark cluster status."

fi



# Check Spark task status

echo "Checking Spark task status..."

if $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --master $SPARK_MASTER_URL --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --num-executors 1 --executor-memory $SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY --driver-memory $SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY $SPARK_HOME/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.4.0.jar 10; then

  echo "Spark task is running with the allocated memory."

else

  echo "Spark task is failing due to insufficient memory allocation. Please increase memory allocation for Spark tasks."

fi


```

## Repair

### Increase the memory allocation for the Spark executor. This can be done by adjusting the `spark.executor.memory` property in the Spark configuration.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the Spark configuration file

SPARK_CONF=${PATH_TO_SPARK_CONFIGURATION_FILE}



# Set the new memory allocation for the Spark executor

NEW_MEMORY=${NEW_MEMORY_ALLOCATION}



# Replace the old memory allocation with the new memory allocation in the Spark configuration file

sed -i "s/spark.executor.memory=.*/spark.executor.memory=$NEW_MEMORY/" $SPARK_CONF



# Restart the Spark application to apply the new configuration

systemctl restart spark


```
